# PredictWeightLiftingQuality

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or [Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, I developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the quality of barbell lifting excercise using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. More information about the original data is available from the [human activity recognition website] (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

I have written the project report in the activity.Rmd file, and generated the activity.html file by knitr in Rstudio.

## Data

The [training data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv) and [test data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv) for this project were downloaded from this [source](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

## Note

This repo was created as part of the assignment of "Practical Machine Learning" class organized by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD, at Johns Hopkins, through Coursera.
